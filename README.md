This is my ongoing project — a Spotify-inspired music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m building it to understand how music players work behind the scenes — from playing audio files to updating the UI dynamically.
🚀 Current Features

✅ Basic UI setup (Spotify-like layout)
✅ Folder structure ready (songs/, and core files)
✅ Audio player integration started

🧩 Upcoming Features

🔜 Play / Pause / Next / Previous functionality
🔜 Progress bar with time updates
🔜 Dynamic song list loading
🔜 Responsive UI
🔜 Song details (title, artist, cover art)
